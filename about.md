      Hello, I’m An, originally from Vietnam, now based in NS, Canada.
      I have over 3 years of GIS-related work, working in the renewable energy industry. <br><br>
      When I'm not chasing my daughter around the house, you can find me reading, writing, or trying to chase my childhood dream of being a pro soccer player.
